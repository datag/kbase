Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal stash of tech notes â€” random findings, experiments, and things Iâ€™ve learned that I donâ€™t want to forget. I figured they might be useful for others too, so Iâ€™m sharing them here.

Everythingâ€™s shared as-is, with no guarantees or warranties â€” some stuff might be outdated, half-baked, or just plain wrong. Use at your own risk (and curiosity)!
